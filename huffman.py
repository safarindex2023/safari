The code you provided implements Huffman coding to encode a given string. Here's an explanation of how it works:

First, the code defines a string to be encoded:

python
Copy code
string = 'BCAADDDCCACACACAAAA'
Next, it defines a class called NodeTree for building the Huffman tree.
 Each node in the tree has a left and right child, which can be another node or a character:

python
Copy code
class NodeTree(object):
    def __init__(self, left=None, right=None):
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
    # ...
The huffman_code_tree function is the main function for constructing the Huffman tree.
 It takes a node (which can be a character or another tree node), a flag indicating whether it's
  the left child, and a binary string to keep track of the path in the tree. 
  It returns a dictionary that maps characters to their Huffman codes:

If the node is a character (leaf node), it returns a dictionary with the character
 as the key and the binary string as the value.
If the node is an internal node (not a character), it recursively calls
 the function on its left and right children. The binary string is updated to '0' for 
  left child and '1' for the right child.
The code then calculates the frequency of each character in the input string and stores it in the freq dictionary:

python
Copy code
freq = {}
for c in string:
    if c in freq:
        freq[c] += 1
    else:
        freq[c] = 1
freq = sorted(freq.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
The freq dictionary is then sorted by frequency in descending order.

The variable nodes is used to keep track of nodes in the Huffman tree. 
Initially, it contains the characters and their frequencies:

python
Copy code
nodes = freq
Then, the code constructs the Huffman tree by merging the nodes with the 
lowest frequencies in a while loop until only one node remains:

Two nodes with the lowest frequencies are removed from nodes.
A new internal node is created, representing the merged characters and their frequencies.
The new node is added back to nodes, and the list is re-sorted.
Once the Huffman tree is constructed, the variable huffmanCode stores
 the mapping of characters to their Huffman codes using the huffman_code_tree function:

python
Copy code
huffmanCode = huffman_code_tree(nodes[0][0])
Finally, the code prints the characters and their corresponding Huffman codes:

python
Copy code
print(' Char | Huffman code ')
print('----------------------')
for (char, frequency) in freq:
    print(' %-4r |%12s' % (char, huffmanCode[char]))
This displays a table with characters and their Huffman codes. 
The Huffman codes are binary strings that represent the compression of the original string.'''
